# Welcome to My Mouse
***

## Task
The task was about to write an algorithm that finds the shortest path in labirinth, there is one enter and one quit, enter point is one and quit point is 2.

## Description
Honestly we thought that this project is really difficult and requires lots of time, but when we started dive in the project we realized that difficult here is to find the suitable algorithm, code you can write for 3 hours at max. I used Lee algorithm, first heard about this algorithm from friend of mine who finished mouse. Found materials about the algorithm from various sources and implemented in our code. Because of some reasons we had to work on only my qwasar account thats why all code pushed from my account however it doesnt mean that my partner (Miranvar) didnt do anything.

## Installation
It is not big project thats why there is no need to install it.

## Usage

here is your maze in 2.map file

10x16* o12
**1*************
*      *      **
*  *   ***     *
*    *        **
*   *         **
*             **
* *           **
*     *        *
***    ***     2
****************

when you execute my program it should find the shortest path.

./my_mouse 1.map

10x16* o12
**1*************
* ooooo*      **
*  *  o***     *
*    *oooooooo**
*   *        o**
*            o**
* *          o**
*     *      oo*
***    ***    o2
****************
20 STEPS

o - the actually the path and 20 the number of steps that needed to be reach quit point.
