# Welcome to My Printf
***

## Task
There is function called printf and our task is to implement this funtions by our own.
## Description
To be honest I've done this project this before, becaouse of some reasons qwasar didnt approve it, eventhough arc one's track completed (100%). Until yesterday it was 100% but this morning this decreased. Thats why it wasnt as difficult as previous one.

## Installation
It is not big project, it is not necessary to install it, if you are interested you can read the code from my git repository.
## Usage
int main()
{
    my_printf("Mastona maston\n");
}

my_printf 

Mastona maston
```
