# Welcome to My Christmas Tree
***

## Task
As I struggled with this project a week, it was pretty difficult for me. the problem was to decrement stars when layer turns.

## Description
I've watched on youtube some videos, somehow wanted to understand qwant's video but then wrote my own logic and magic happened.

## Installation
it is not big programm, it doesnt have Installations, and you cant install it.

## Usage
you should create a programm that has number of layers which was given by user. 
```
./my_christmas_tree 4
              *
             ***
            *****
           *******
