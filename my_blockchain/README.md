## Task
the was about to implemtent basic version of Blockchain, which include nodes and inside this nodes there should be list of blocks.

## Description
it took me one week to understand how it works, I watched youtube videos where I couldn't find exact material I wanted, later eventually my lovely mentor (Otabek aka) helped me.
