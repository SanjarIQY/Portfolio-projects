# Welcome to My Ls
***

## Task
there is "ls" command is which is used to print all the files and directories in the present directory in the form of a list, and the task was about to implement this command by ourselves.

## Description
First, I searched and read some stuff about ls asked from students because I rarely used this command. Then I started to write code, it takes about 2 weeks to finish it and troubled in sorting files especially at sorting by last modification.

## Installation
It is not big project and you there is no need to install itm but if you are interested in my code you can see it in my github profile, I want to add this project to my portfolio. Here is the link https://github.com/SanjarIQY/Portfolio

## Usage
For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, my_ls displays its name as well as any requested, associated information. For each operand that names a file of type directory, my_ls displays the names of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated information.

If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed. If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.

The following options are available:

-a Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).
-t Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands by lexicographical order.
```
./my_ls -a
